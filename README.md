Hello! This is my personal website. I'm Matteo, a full stack developer based in Italy. I'm currently working at Carol, a company that specializes in digital medicine.

## About this website

This website is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. As I'm a fan of retro UI, I decided to make it look like an old school desktop.
It's still a work in progress!

## How to run it

You can run it locally by cloning the repository, installing the dependencies typing `npm install` (or `yarn install` | `pnpm install`) in your terminal and running `npm run dev`.

The website will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

The live version is available at [https://matteobreda.dev/](https://matteobreda.dev/) (deployed on Netlify).
